                <p>
                    Mental health is not just a matter of biology or diagnosis. It is shaped by the culture we grow up in, the values we inherit, and the way our communities define strength, weakness, and belonging. In many Western societies, there has been a growing openness around discussing mental health, seeking therapy, and naming emotional struggles. But for many South Asian communities, mental illness is still surrounded by silence, shame, and fear of judgment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This project explores how mental health stigma functions in South Asian cultural contexts, especially among immigrants and diaspora families. It also looks at how these views differ from those found in Western settings. Concepts like izzat, or family honor, play a major role in shaping how people experience distress and whether they feel safe talking about it. Many South Asian individuals, especially women, grow up with the belief that expressing emotional pain could bring dishonor to the family or make them appear weak in the eyes of others. Gilbert, Gilbert, and Sanghera describe how this sense of reflected shame can create a powerful pressure to stay silent, even when the psychological burden becomes overwhelming.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Birtel and Mitchell, along with Mirza and colleagues, found that South Asian participants were more likely than White British participants to view mental illness as a moral or spiritual issue, rather than a medical one. They were also more likely to distance themselves socially from someone with a mental health condition. Taylor, Brown, and Weinman found that North Indian women living in the United Kingdom were less likely to recommend professional help for a person in distress, even though they themselves reported higher levels of emotional difficulty.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These findings reveal an important truth. Cultural stigma does not just influence how mental illness is seen. It also affects whether people reach out for help, how long they wait, and how deeply they suffer in silence. By comparing South Asian and Western cultural frameworks, this project aims to better understand the emotional costs of stigma and the possibilities for creating safer, more open paths to healing.

                    <h3>Cultural Context</h3>
                    <p>
                        Mental health is viewed through different cultural lenses across the world. In many Western societies, conversations around therapy and mental illness are becoming more normalized. In contrast, South Asian communities often link emotional distress with family shame, spiritual weakness, or moral failure. These cultural beliefs can delay diagnosis, prevent treatment, and increase emotional suffering. This project focuses on how these deep cultural values influence mental health stigma and service use, particularly among South Asian immigrants compared to their Western counterparts.
